# Region_Growing_and_Region_Merging_Segmentation
1. Region Growing Segmentation
 * PROBLEM
      * 洧녭(洧논,洧녽) : input image (shape 洧녴 洧논 洧녵)
      * 洧녡(洧논,洧녽) : 1s at seed point and 0s elsewhere (shape 洧녴 洧논 洧녵)
      * 洧녟 	  : predicate to apply at each location (洧논,洧녽)
 * SOLUTION
      * Find all connected components in 洧녡(洧논,洧녽) and reduce each connected component to one pixel; label all such pixels found as 1. All other pixels in 洧녡 are labeled 0  
      * Form an image 洧녭<sub>洧녟</sub> such that at each point (洧논,洧녽), 洧녭<sub>洧녟</sub>(洧논,洧녽)=1 if the input image satisfies a given predicate,洧녟, at those coordinates, and 洧녭<sub>洧녟</sub>(洧논,洧녽)=0 otherwise.
      * Let 洧녮 be an image formed by appending to each seed point in 洧녡 all the 1-valued points in 洧녭<sub>洧녟</sub> that are 8-connected to that seed point.
      * Label each connected component in 洧녮 with a different region label (e.g.,integers or letters). This is the segmented image obtained by region growing.
 
2.Region Spliting and Merging Segmentation
 * PROBLEM
      * 洧녭(洧논,洧녽) : input image (shape 洧녴 洧논 洧녵)
      * 洧녟 	  : predicate to apply at each location (洧논,洧녽)
 * SOLUTION
      * Split into four disjoint quadrants any region Ri for which Q(R<sub>i</sub>) = FALSE.
      * When no further splitting is possible, merge any adjacent regions Rj and Rk for which Q(R<sub>j</sub> U R<sub>k</sub>) = TRUE.
